This repo has three branches: master, object-oriented, functional.

The end of the master branch is the starting point, the object-oriented and
functional branches are the implementation of the same set of functionality done
in an objected-oriented approach and a functional approach respectively.

### Branches

I would recommend walk through each commit of each branch to compare and
contrast the differences in the styles.
